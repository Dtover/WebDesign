## This repository is my Web curriculum design 

#### Introduction 

*Initial idea:*  
I decide to make a games-related website due my passion for games. So I take example by the website called [vgtime](https://vgtime.com),It is a brief style, and I like it so I imitate some part of it for the usage of my own design. Most important is that I copy all the games' information of my website from it(vgtime).

*Result:*  
It call it **GIC** (it is a abbreviation of **Game Information and Comments**). By means of its name you might know what it's for. Nothing special. It is just a website where you can get the information of the game that you want to know, and you can leave you comment in its page. Besides, if you are in favour of some games, you could add it to you likes collection in yourself homepage.

*Something else:*  
I make all functions work just in condition of using html, css. javascript.
